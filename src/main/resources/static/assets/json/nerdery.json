  "company_overview" : "We’re bursting at the seams with technical experts because we’ve faithfully pursued our vision: to be the best place in the world for nerds to work.\nIt comes naturally to us, being founded by three pioneer programmers, to make a nerd-friendly environment – that’s what we’ve done for hundreds of employees at our offices in Minneapolis, Chicago, Kansas City and Phoenix.\nSure, we have a dog-friendly workplace, a perpetual chess tournament and rather epic holiday parties, but the most critical ingredient in keeping a group of technical geniuses happy (other than caffeine) is compelling problems to solve. Luckily, our unique business model ensures that we never run short on interesting problems to sink our teeth into.",
